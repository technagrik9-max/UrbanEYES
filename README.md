# 🏙️ CleanCity – Smarter Pollution Reporting

## 🚩 Problem
Today, citizen pollution complaints are scattered across WhatsApp or helplines, often unverifiable and without ground-truth mapping. Cities struggle with:
- No evidence-based tracking (photo + location missing)  
- No SLA/resolution monitoring  
- No prioritization of hotspots  

## 💡 Our Solution
**CleanCity** transforms scattered complaints into clear, city-validated tasks.  

1. **Citizen reporting**  
   - Snap a photo → app validates GPS with the selected city via **OpenStreetMap**.  
   - Report is submitted with verified evidence (photo + coordinates).  

2. **Backend system** (Node.js + MongoDB)  
   - Photos stored securely in **Cloudinary**.  
   - Location indexed **geospatially** for hotspot analysis.  
   - Status tracked from *pending → resolved*.  

3. **Authority dashboard**  
   - Live map with filters for prioritization.  
   - Analytics: top polluted areas, resolution times, officer performance.  

4. **Trust & transparency**  
   - **Anti-spoofing**: city must match GPS (prevents fake cross-city spam).  
   - **Evidence-first**: every report is backed with a photo + precise location.  
   - **Audit trail**: timestamps + role-based access (citizens vs. admins).  

## ✨ What Makes It Unique
- ✅ Open & low-cost: OSM + MongoDB, deployable in any city.  
- ✅ Interoperable: clean REST APIs → easy CRM/municipal integration.  
- ✅ Future-ready: AI & IoT integrations planned.  
- ✅ Citizen engagement: gamified points, badges, and leaderboards.  

## 🤖 Smart Features
- **ML-powered classifier**: Auto-detects pollution type (garbage, smoke, vehicle, etc.) using a Python ML model.  
- **Continuous learning**: Model improves accuracy as more data is collected.  
- **Faster validation**: Reduces manual review for municipal officers.  

## 🎮 Gamification for Impact
- Citizens earn **points, badges, and ranks** for reporting.  
- Leaderboards encourage healthy competition.  
- Schools, communities, and volunteers can compete as **Eco-Champions**.  

## 🚀 Why Now
- Rising pollution + lack of actionable citizen data.  
- Municipalities demand **evidence-based, low-cost** solutions.  
- CleanCity bridges the gap: **citizen transparency + official accountability**.
